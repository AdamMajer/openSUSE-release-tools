Introduction
------------
[id="intro"]

In the current Factory model,
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory:ToTest[Factory:ToTest]
represents the project that stores several Factory Snapshots that are
candidates to be released if the measured quality (according to
openQA) is good enough.

This plugin encapsulates several conditions that are needed to decide
if a snapshot can be published or not:

* Check if the overall status of openQA is green.

* Check if all the repositories in openSUSE:Factory can be published.

If Factory meets both criteria, this plugin will publish a new version
of the project openSUSE:Factory:ToTest, if the version is different
from the current Factory.
