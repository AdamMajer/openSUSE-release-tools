  and add it again. 

- address missing owner functionality in systemd-tmpfiles (fate#314974)
  1022-systemd-tmpfiles-ownerkeep.patch

- Generate the bash completion files on the fly for th ecase of
  not having the package bash-completion around 

- Update to Release v210 
  + systemd will now relabel /dev after loading the SMACK policy
    according to SMACK rules.
  + A new unit file option AppArmoreProfile= has been added to
    set the AppArmor profile for the processes of a unit.
  + A new condition check ConditionArchitecture= has been added
    to conditionalize units based on the system architecture, as
    reported by uname()'s "machine" field.
  + systemd-networkd now supports matching on the system
    virtualization, architecture, kernel command line, host name
    and machine ID.
  + logind is now a lot more aggressive when suspending the
    machine due to a closed laptop lid.
  + logind will now watch SW_DOCK switches and inhibit reaction
    to the lid switch if it is pressed.
  + nspawn will now make use of the devices cgroup controller by
    default, and only permit creation of and access to the usual
    API device nodes like /dev/null or /dev/random, as well as
    access to (but not creation of) the pty devices.
  + systemd will now understand the usual M, K, G, T suffixes
    according to SI conventions (i.e. to the base 1000) when</description>
