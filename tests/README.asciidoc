Testing
=======

Dependencies
------------

Test suite is using +nose+, +httpretty+ and +mock+ for testing. You need these
three python modules installed to run tests. In openSUSE, you can do it using
the following command as a root:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
zypper in python-nose python-httpretty python-mock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running tests
-------------

To run the tests, you need to be in the topmost directory of your checkout and
run the following command there:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nosetests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of the suite
----------------------

Each object is containing functions for the individual tests so split them per
area of interest.

In directory fixtures there are resulting xml files obtained from the OBS with
osc api calls.

Each xml then needs to be overridden in the test so we mock the right file with
the proper url.
