Test structure with nose:

To execute tests run "nosetests" in the root project directory.

Each object is containing functions for the individual tests
so split them per area of interest.

In directory fixtures there are resulting xml files obtained
from the OBS with osc api calls.

Each xml then needs to be overriden in the test so we mock
the right file with the proper url.
