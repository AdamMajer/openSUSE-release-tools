current deployment:

openqa.opensuse.org syncs factory isos in a cron job and generates
pickle files to store changelog information in
/var/lib/openqa/factory/snapshot-changes/

the obs factory publisher script fetches the diff for the to be
published snapshot from openqa.opensuse.org via http. Then sets the
current version to the snapshot number via post request.

the factory announcer script runs on the packagelists vm, polling
the changelog file that was created by the publish script.
