This set of scripts is used to generate the tumbleweed snapshot
announcement mails.

scripts
-------

factory-package-news.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main tool

- extract changelog information from rpm packages contained in iso
  images (command 'save'). The information is stored as pickle file
  in the specified directory.
- create diff between previously saved pickle files (command 'diff')

factory-package-news-web.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple web service to generate diffs between specified snapshots and
to set the last announced snapshot version.

announcer.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~
sends a mail with the current changelog if the the snapshot
published on download.opensuse.org is newer than the last announced
one

current deployment on opensuse.org
----------------------------------

openqa.opensuse.org syncs factory isos in a cron job and generates
pickle files to store changelog information in
/var/lib/openqa/factory/snapshot-changes/

the obs factory publisher script fetches the diff for the to be
published snapshot from openqa.opensuse.org via http. Then sets the
current version to the snapshot number via post request.

the factory announcer script runs on the packagelists vm, polling
the changelog file that was created by the publish script.
