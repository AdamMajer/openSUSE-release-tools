Test structure with nose:

To execute tests run "nosetests" in the tests directory.

Each object is containing functions for the individual tests
so split them per area of interest.

In directory fixtures there are resulting xml files obtained
from the OBS with osc api calls.

Each xml then needs to be overriden in the test so we open
proper file where needed.

TODO:

convert the patched http_GET to normal function which does mapping for urls -> files

figure out why relative paths for osc commands do not work when executed from unittest
